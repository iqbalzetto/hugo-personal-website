Hello, I am a programmer, I make web related stuff

I like music, sometimes I take my guitar and sing wonderwall, or creep or whatever song that is not complicated
I can only jreng jreng and sing, and I'm happy with that.

I also like to read fantasies stuff, manga or light novel. Sometimes I want to write my own somehow.

This web is my first time playing with Hugo and I am not well versed in markdown format, but I am quite excited to see what I can do with it. Wish me luck, Cheers!


Yours Truly,

Mohammmad Iqbal
